ðŸš¦ Task 5: Accident Analysis

This is Task 5 of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech.

ðŸ“„ Description

In this task, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and created visualizations on a sample accident dataset to identify trends and patterns.
The analysis highlights accident counts per city, severity distribution, and common causes of accidents.

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used

Python

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn


ðŸ“Š Sample Output

Below are some of the visualizations generated from the analysis:

Accidents per City:
A bar chart showing the number of accidents in each city (New York, Chicago, Boston).

Accident Severity Distribution:
A bar chart displaying how accidents are distributed across different severity levels (1 to 4).

Causes of Accidents:
A bar chart highlighting the most frequent causes of accidents, such as Speeding, Drunk Driving, etc.


These visualizations help to better understand the dataset and can be used to derive actionable insights for road safety improvements.
